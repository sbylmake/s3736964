## My interest in IT

Most of my younger memories involve me taking apart (and inevitably breaking) my family’s computers. In my mind, those futile exercises were the keys to unlocking truth of how it was possible for me to play a game of pinball on a screen, but they only got me so far. 

Further into my teen years (and with a greater respect for the screws keeping my computer together) I began to learn the intricacies of these seemingly magical devices, through the power of code - Java, Python, Swift, SQL, C# - to try and understand the relationship between these different dialects of broken English, and the way they interacted with a computer’s hardware. 

My intrigue led me to study Software Design & Development during high school, and now a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT, which will further expanded my knowledge on what this sector of technology is truly capable of. 

## Why RMIT?

I made the choice to commence my IT studies at RMIT as my internet research throughout RMIT’s Subreddit, website, general internet forums and course structure documents revealed that RMIT provided the most up to date and reputable IT course within the Melbourne CBD area. 

This led me to decide that RMIT was the best decision for my education as well as my commute. As I moved to Melbourne from NSW, during my brief trips here before the final move, I visited RMIT’s Melbourne City Campus (as well as The University of Melbourne & Swinburne) and was incredibly impressed at the functionality and grandeur of its resources.

### What makes this position appealing to me?

This Cybersecurity Analyst role appeals to myself as it is a first hand role in the relation between cybersecurity and the livelihood of an organisation, as this role is required to conduct compliance activities which will aid the business in maintaining its ISM (Australian Government Information Security Manual) rating. The position is also located in the Melbourne CBD and has a starting salary of > $100,000. Another aspect of this role which appeals to me personally is how it involves lots of human interaction - I wouldn’t just be delegated to IT jobs within this position. I wish to improve my communication skills and would like to take on this opportunity to further advance them in a more business-oriented circumstance, due to the collaboration with support teams and development of compliance reports listed as part of this role.

```markdown 
**Skills, qualifications & experience required for this position**

1. Practical, industry experience with the development and/or support security controls 
   within operations which home at least one security domain
2. Experience with the ISM (Australian Government Information Security Manual) or similar 
   industry standard procedures
3. Management & communication skills with the ability to collaborate with a diverse range 
   of support teams
4. A deep understanding of the world of information security & future development of this
   environment
5. Hold Australian government security clearance (or the ability to gain it)
```
### Which of these qualifications, skills & experience do I possess?

I currently have a very surface level understanding of the world of information security, and how it relates to the internal and external security of sensitive data within organisations. I also don’t have relevant qualifications for this role, as I have only just began my Bachelor of Information Technology degree, and have never had practical experience working within this industry.

### How will I gain the required attributes for this position?

Through completing my Bachelor of Information Technology degree - majoring in cybersecurity - I will have gained the essential qualification for entering the cybersecurity industry, however due to my lack of experience, I could only justifiably enter the industry at a junior position, a role that could potentially provide me with the experience to fulfill my selected Cybersecurity Analyst role in later years.

```

### What do these results mean to me?

The results of each of these 3 tests clearly convey that I am a mostly extroverted, analytical, leadership oriented person. For me, this is no surprise. I enjoy finding the objective truth in situations (be that social or work-related) and am comfortable taking charge in situations where I believe I am qualified. I also enjoy mingling, small talk-style social activities as I like the act of making first impressions and learning as much about as many people in the room so I can build social connections and gather a rich tapestry of interesting and influential friends who allow me to gain a multifaceted perspective of the world.

### How do these results influence my behaivour in a team?

Within a team, these results can benefit me if I harness them correctly. My analytical behaviors allow me to take the different prerogatives of team members into consideration, and interact with them in ways relevant to their respective traits. I am comfortable taking leadership positions as I am a very organised person and love planning, however when other members of the team have similar attributes it may create conflict. Fortunately, I am comfortable with relinquishing leadership as I don’t allow myself to take it personally.

### How should I take these results into account when forming a team?

When forming a team, I keep in mind the leadership attributes of the team members, and whether they are mostly outgoing individuals who are comfortable with pitching ideas, or whether they are more reserved and prefer to take an indirect approach to teamwork. If it’s the first case, I would like to ensure that the team doesn’t have a main leader, as that could create shifts in the team dynamic, as everyone wants to believe that their voice is just as important as each others. In the second case, I would prefer to instill myself as a leader and deal with each team member separately in order to form a systematic plan for the team’s work, and allow them to collaborate over less direct mediums in order for the team members to complete their work at their own place, whilst keeping everyone else in consideration.


## Project Pitch: InGrain

### Overview

‘InGrain’ is a task manager application which creates a productive environment for the user to complete their tasks in the most efficient manner possible, as it integrates with the behaviour of your phone as an entity. It which allows users to input tasks they wish to complete on a time basis of their choosing (e.g. Floss Teeth - Once a Day) to encourage them to practice and develop new skills & habits, as well as input & complete regular ‘to-do’ tasks, - however, the key to InGrain is how it uses features such as disabling notifications, music libraries, alarms, weather, social media, & maps in order for the user to complete their tasks in the most reasonable, efficient format possible.

### Motivation

Task manager apps have been a staple to the smartphone landscape since their inception, as they are a no brainer - keeping an easily updatable list of errands on you at all times is an invaluable tool. However, through the constant innovation of technology and the market’s competitive nature, users have been gifted with vast improvements to the fundamentals of this style of app, as what was once simply an updatable list, now had features such as setting alarms for completion time, adding collaborators to lists, highlighting particular tasks for higher importance, cloud sharing across devices - all of which are highly practical attributes. However, they only get you so far. The motivation and journey of completing a task all comes from within the user, still. Therefore, with InGrain, I aim to include all these listed features within a greater interface, an interface which provides the user with the ideal environment and tools to complete their tasks or reaffirm habits to the best of their ability. 

As well as that, task manager apps are my favourite use of my smartphone/devices. They allow me to keep my life in track and manage my time as efficiently as possible. Therefore, my intimate use of many of these apps has given me first had experience into what makes them good, what makes them awful, and what they all need to do better - and InGrain will provide the solution to all of those queries.


```markdown 
**Description**

1. InGrain’s inherent purpose is to allow users to be the most productive versions of 
   themselves. As previously mentioned, InGrain aims to achieve this through 
   manipulating and modifying the digital environment of the user. For example, a user 
   inputs the habit (a repeated task) of cycling. They also input that they want to 
   fulfil this habit 3 times a week. InGrain sees the habit of ‘cycling’ and uses 
   location based data do determine the best weather for the user to complete this task,
   and determines which days in the users week will work for cycling in order for the 
   user to schedule their life around that. As well as that, when the user allows the 
   app to know that they are currently completing this cycling task, InGrain will disable 
   notifications, set up a cycling playlist (with the streaming service of the user’s 
   choice), keep the user on track with directions from the map app (if necessary) & 
   time & measure the cycle to provide the user with helpful information on this task, 
   as well as an array of analytics on how to improve the completion of the habit for 
   the next time they carry it out.
   
2. This array of highly intelligent features provide InGrain with a competitive edge 
   in the oversaturated market of productivity applications, as it understands that the 
   different lives of users can greatly inhibit/benefit the completion of particular 
   tasks. InGrain takes as much as it can into consideration, as it integrates itself 
   into the life of the user, rather than the user seeing it as a burden.
   
3. The user data within apps such as Google Maps, Calendar, Drive & Gmail (as long as 
   the user provides permissions) can provide extra help to the user in completing 
   their tasks - such as if a user inputs a task of ‘Start IT Assignment’, InGrain can 
   use that data to create a new Google Doc labeled ‘IT Assignment’ for the user. Or if 
   the user inputs the task of ‘Go to the gym’, InGrain can provide directions to the 
   gym, offer workout plans, integrate with Spotify/Apple Music/Tidal playlists in order 
   to find appropriate music & also take into consideration other exercise tasks the user 
   has completed recently in order to give them relevant information on how many calories 
   they should aim to burn.
   
5. Although not currently feasible, the endgame of InGrain would be an all-over 
   integration with a desktop version, Google Home/Alexa, smartwatch - the internet of 
   things. Consumers will have their reluctance over a program having such a deep window 
   into their lives, as InGrain could potentially learn more about the user than they know 
   about themselves. This is a factor which could lead to highly impactful data breaches, 
   yet InGrain’s testament and determination to making InGrain as beneficial as possible 
   for users would ensure that the growing technolgicalification of personal lives retains 
   integrity.
```

### Tools & technologies

InGrain will be an application designed for smartphones on the iOS operating system (Android TBD). It will be designed and programmed within Apple’s free IDE, Xcode (and coded with the Swift language). This enables InGrain to work on any of Apple’s native mobile devices, such as the range of iPhones (post-iPhone 6) and iPads (post-iPad 2). InGrain will not (initially) have a desktop counterpart application, as its features are currently designed for mobile phones, however in the future that is a likely addition - as well as Apple Watch integration as well (for features such as disabling notifications, etc).

### Skills required

This project will not be a single programmer undertaking, as the frameworks of the application are very complex. The application will need to interact with the device’s own settings, which isn’t the most straightforward task, therefore a team of advanced programmers would be required to delegate and organise the development of the app. However, as iOS programming is a highly saturated field, finding the developers with the correct skill set should not be an impossible feat. As for hardware and software, all required for development will be a powerful Mac computer running the OSX operating system, with Xcode installed on the computer, as well as a few Apple mobile devices to test the app on (Xcode runs its own device simulator within the IDE, therefore these devices aren’t even necessary for development).

### Outcome

If after rigorous debugging, focus group testing & real world use, the app is deemed to be inherently successful, it will then reach the App Store market, listed for free (revenue will be accrued through in-app advertisements). Ideally, the outcome would be that consumers now have an incredibly useful task manager application which renders simpler versions of the app as obsolete, and allows these users to live a more productive life. The impact of InGrain’s development will be that consumers now have a higher standard for what their apps can do, and the marketplace will focus more upon ensuring that their work meets these new standards, in turn leading us to become a more progressive society.
