## The Personal Essay of Sarah Bylmakers

I decided to do something different for this section of my IE University application. I hope you enjoy, as the answers are integrated throughout this website.


## My interest in IT

Most of my younger memories involve me taking apart (and inevitably breaking) my family’s computers. In my mind, those futile exercises were the keys to unlocking truth of how it was possible for me to play a game of pinball on a screen, but they only got me so far. 

Further into my teen years (and with a greater respect for the screws keeping my computer together) I began to learn the intricacies of these seemingly magical devices, through the power of code - via languages such Java, Python, Swift, SQL, C# - to try and understand the relationship between these different dialects of broken English, and the way they interact with a computer’s hardware. 

This intrigue led me to study Software Design & Development during high school, and now the Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT, which will further expanded my knowledge on what this sector of technology is truly capable of.

## Why IE University?

My older sister Nicola impressed me a lot when I was in 6th grade, as she went on a 1.5 exchange to a university in Gualajara as a part
of her university degree. When she returned, she was fluent in Spanish, and that helped her get a job with a Spanish company in our
home of Sydney. I wanted to copy her, but make it my own. She helped me love the language of Spanish, first with music such from artists
such as Natalia La Fourcade, and now with Rosalia, so I aimed to make Spanish a hobby of mine, so I could learn without strict rules,
and help it change my life in the future. Eventually, my motivation faltered, and I had to have some language rules instilled onto me,
so I began taking Spanish classes at my school.

Fast forward, after beginning university, I immediately contacted faculty to enquire about which Spanish universities I could exchange to, with my particular course. IE University was the first one listed, and I stuck with it. I have been looking forward to the chance
of studying there so much, many conversations I have had with IE students on the website have provided me with a great insight into what my life could be like if I am granted the chance to study there, and live in the beautiful city of Madrid.

**What do I expect to learn during my studies?**

1. I hope to gain a deeper and practical understanding into the rapidly changing IT landscape 
   operating throughout both corporate and consumer worlds - in regards to aspects such as 
   troubleshooting, designing and problem solving IT infrastructure such as applications, 
   websites, physical hardware components and multitudes more.
   
2. I expect to learn a great deal about the industry and employment within the IT industry, 
   and how to make my credentials stand out in the crowd when it comes to my post-graduate 
   life.
   
3. Make friends and get to know this new city!

### What makes this position appealing to me?

This Cybersecurity Analyst role appeals to myself as it is a first hand role in the relation between cybersecurity and the livelihood of an organisation, as this role is required to conduct compliance activities which will aid the business in maintaining its ISM (Australian Government Information Security Manual) rating. The position is also located in the Melbourne CBD and has a starting salary of > $100,000 - 2 points which I find very appealing. Another aspect of this position which appeals to me personally is how it involves lots of human interaction - I wouldn’t just be delegated to IT jobs within this prole. I wish to improve my communication skills and would like to take on this opportunity to further advance them in a more business-oriented circumstance, due to the collaboration with support teams and development of compliance reports listed as an aspect of this role.

```markdown 
**Skills, qualifications & experience required for this position**

1. Practical, industry experience with the development and/or support security controls 
   within operations which home at least one security domain
   
2. Experience with the ISM (Australian Government Information Security Manual) or similar 
   industry standard procedures
   
3. Management & communication skills with the ability to collaborate with a diverse range 
   of support teams
   
4. A deep understanding of the world of information security & future development of this
   environment
   
5. Hold Australian government security clearance (or the ability to gain it)
```
### Which of these qualifications, skills & experience do I possess?

I currently have a very surface level understanding of the world of information security, and how it relates to the internal and external security of sensitive data within organisations. I also don’t have relevant qualifications for this role, as I have only just began my Bachelor of Information Technology degree, and have never had practical experience working within this industry - another requirement that this position seeks.

### How will I gain the required attributes for this position?

Through completing my Bachelor of Information Technology degree - majoring in cybersecurity - I will have gained the base qualification for entering the cybersecurity industry (a degree), however due to my lack of industry experience, I could only justifiably enter the industry at a junior position, into a role that could potentially provide me with the experience and qualifications to fulfill my selected Cybersecurity Analyst role in later years.
