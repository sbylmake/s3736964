## My interest in IT

Most of my younger memories involve me taking apart (and inevitably breaking) my family’s computers. In my mind, those futile exercises were the keys to unlocking truth of how it was possible for me to play a game of pinball on a screen, but they only got me so far. 

Further into my teen years (and with a greater respect for the screws keeping my computer together) I began to learn the intricacies of these seemingly magical devices, through the power of code - Java, Python, Swift, SQL, C# - to try and understand the relationship between these different dialects of broken English, and the way they interacted with a computer’s hardware. 

My intrigue led me to study Software Design & Development during high school, and now a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT, which will further expanded my knowledge on what this sector of technology is truly capable of. 

## Why RMIT?

I made the choice to commence my IT studies at RMIT as my internet research throughout RMIT’s Subreddit, website, general internet forums and course structure documents revealed that RMIT provided the most up to date and reputable IT course within the Melbourne CBD area. 

This led me to decide that RMIT was the best decision for my education as well as my commute. As I moved to Melbourne from NSW, during my brief trips here before the final move, I visited RMIT’s Melbourne City Campus (as well as The University of Melbourne & Swinburne) and was incredibly impressed at the functionality and grandeur of its resources.

**What do I expect to learn during my studies?**

1. I hope to gain a deeper, practical understanding into the rapidly changing IT landscape 
   operating throughout both corporate and consumer worlds - in regards to aspects such as 
   troubleshooting, designing and problem solving IT infrastructure such as applications, 
   websites, physical hardware components and multitudes more.
2. I expect to learn a great deal about the industry and employment within the IT industry, 
   and how to make my credentials stand out in the crowd when it comes to my post-graduate 
   life.
3. Make friends and get to know this new city!

### What makes this position appealing to me?

This Cybersecurity Analyst role appeals to myself as it is a first hand role in the relation between cybersecurity and the livelihood of an organisation, as this role is required to conduct compliance activities which will aid the business in maintaining its ISM (Australian Government Information Security Manual) rating. The position is also located in the Melbourne CBD and has a starting salary of > $100,000. Another aspect of this role which appeals to me personally is how it involves lots of human interaction - I wouldn’t just be delegated to IT jobs within this position. I wish to improve my communication skills and would like to take on this opportunity to further advance them in a more business-oriented circumstance, due to the collaboration with support teams and development of compliance reports listed as part of this role.
