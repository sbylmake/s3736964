## My interest in IT

Most of my younger memories involve me taking apart (and inevitably breaking) my family’s computers. In my mind, those futile exercises were the keys to unlocking truth of how it was possible for me to play a game of pinball on a screen, but they only got me so far. 

Further into my teen years (and with a greater respect for the screws keeping my computer together) I began to learn the intricacies of these seemingly magical devices, through the power of code - Java, Python, Swift, SQL, C# - to try and understand the relationship between these different dialects of broken English, and the way they interacted with a computer’s hardware. 

My intrigue led me to study Software Design & Development during high school, and now a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT, which will further expanded my knowledge on what this sector of technology is truly capable of. 

## Why RMIT?

I made the choice to commence my IT studies at RMIT as my internet research throughout RMIT’s Subreddit, website, general internet forums and course structure documents revealed that RMIT provided the most up to date and reputable IT course within the Melbourne CBD area. 

This led me to decide that RMIT was the best decision for my education as well as my commute. As I moved to Melbourne from NSW, during my brief trips here before the final move, I visited RMIT’s Melbourne City Campus (as well as The University of Melbourne & Swinburne) and was incredibly impressed at the functionality and grandeur of its resources.

### What makes this position appealing to me?

This Cybersecurity Analyst role appeals to myself as it is a first hand role in the relation between cybersecurity and the livelihood of an organisation, as this role is required to conduct compliance activities which will aid the business in maintaining its ISM (Australian Government Information Security Manual) rating. The position is also located in the Melbourne CBD and has a starting salary of > $100,000. Another aspect of this role which appeals to me personally is how it involves lots of human interaction - I wouldn’t just be delegated to IT jobs within this position. I wish to improve my communication skills and would like to take on this opportunity to further advance them in a more business-oriented circumstance, due to the collaboration with support teams and development of compliance reports listed as part of this role.

```markdown 
**Skills, qualifications & experience required for this position**

1. Practical, industry experience with the development and/or support security controls 
   within operations which home at least one security domain
2. Experience with the ISM (Australian Government Information Security Manual) or similar 
   industry standard procedures
3. Management & communication skills with the ability to collaborate with a diverse range 
   of support teams
4. A deep understanding of the world of information security & future development of this
   environment
5. Hold Australian government security clearance (or the ability to gain it)
```
### Which of these qualifications, skills & experience do I possess?

I currently have a very surface level understanding of the world of information security, and how it relates to the internal and external security of sensitive data within organisations. I also don’t have relevant qualifications for this role, as I have only just began my Bachelor of Information Technology degree, and have never had practical experience working within this industry.

### How will I gain the required attributes for this position?

Through completing my Bachelor of Information Technology degree - majoring in cybersecurity - I will have gained the essential qualification for entering the cybersecurity industry, however due to my lack of experience, I could only justifiably enter the industry at a junior position, a role that could potentially provide me with the experience to fulfill my selected Cybersecurity Analyst role in later years.


## Project Pitch: InGrain

### Overview

‘InGrain’ is a task manager application which creates a productive environment for the user to complete their tasks in the most efficient manner possible, as it integrates with the behaviour of your phone as an entity. It which allows users to input tasks they wish to complete on a time basis of their choosing (e.g. Floss Teeth - Once a Day) to encourage them to practice and develop new skills & habits, as well as input & complete regular ‘to-do’ tasks, - however, the key to InGrain is how it uses features such as disabling notifications, music libraries, alarms, weather, social media, & maps in order for the user to complete their tasks in the most reasonable, efficient format possible.

### Motivation

Task manager apps have been a staple to the smartphone landscape since their inception, as they are a no brainer - keeping an easily updatable list of errands on you at all times is an invaluable tool. However, through the constant innovation of technology and the market’s competitive nature, users have been gifted with vast improvements to the fundamentals of this style of app, as what was once simply an updatable list, now had features such as setting alarms for completion time, adding collaborators to lists, highlighting particular tasks for higher importance, cloud sharing across devices - all of which are highly practical attributes. However, they only get you so far. The motivation and journey of completing a task all comes from within the user, still. Therefore, with InGrain, I aim to include all these listed features within a greater interface, an interface which provides the user with the ideal environment and tools to complete their tasks or reaffirm habits to the best of their ability. 

As well as that, task manager apps are my favourite use of my smartphone/devices. They allow me to keep my life in track and manage my time as efficiently as possible. Therefore, my intimate use of many of these apps has given me first had experience into what makes them good, what makes them awful, and what they all need to do better - and InGrain will provide the solution to all of those queries.

**Description**
1. InGrain’s inherent purpose is to allow users to be the most productive versions of themselves. As previously mentioned,        InGrain aims to achieve this through manipulating and modifying the digital environment of the user. For example, a user      inputs the habit (a repeated task) of cycling. They also input that they want to fulfil this habit 3 times a week. InGrain    sees the habit of ‘cycling’ and uses location based data do determine the best weather for the user to complete this task,    and determines which days in the users week will work for cycling in order for the user to schedule their life around          that. As well as that, when the user lets the app know that they are currently completing this cycling task, InGrain will      disable notifications, set up a cycling playlist (with the streaming service of the user’s choice), keep the user on track    with directions from the map app (if necessary) & time & measure the cycle to provide the user with helpful information on    this task, as well as an array of analytics on how to improve the completion of the habit for the next time they carry it      out.

2. The array of highly intelligent features provide InGrain with a competitive edge in the oversaturated market of                productivity applications, as it understands that the different lives of users can greatly inhibit/benefit the completion
   of particular tasks. InGrain takes as much as it can into consideration, as it integrates itself into the life of the user,    rather than the user seeing it as a burden.

3. The user data within apps such as Google Maps, Calendar, Drive & Gmail (as long as the user provides permissions) can          provide extra help to the user in completing their tasks - such as if a user inputs a task of ‘Start IT Assignment’,          InGrain can use that data to create a new Google Doc labeled ‘IT Assignment’ for the user. Or if the user inputs the task      of ‘Go to the gym’, InGrain can provide directions to the gym, offer workout plans, integrate with Spotify/Apple              Music/Tidal playlists in order to find appropriate music & also take into consideration other exercise tasks the user has      completed recently in order to give them relevant information on how many calories they should aim to burn.

4. Although not currently feasible, the endgame of InGrain would be an all-over integration with a desktop version, Google        Home/Alexa, smartwatch - the internet of things. Consumers will have their reluctance over a program having such a deep        window into their lives, as InGrain could potentially learn more about the user than they know about themselves. This is a    factor which could lead to highly impactful data breaches, yet InGrain’s testament and determination to making InGrain as      beneficial as possible for users would ensure that the growing technolgicalification of personal lives retains integrity.
